#Lone Star Map

Was looking for a little taste of home while here in NYC so I wrote the nice people at the Pabst brewing company and they sent me a handy list of all the places that have ordered "The Official Beer of Texas" in the last 90 days. (This was on 3.24.2017).

Turned that list into a map.

Please feel free to pull request to keep the data up to date.

Cheers, Y'all.
